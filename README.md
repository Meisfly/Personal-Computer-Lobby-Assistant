# Personal-Computer-Lobby-Assistant
This is just an open repository for the author to upload and share rainmeter skins, more specifically recreations of lobby assistants (not the Live 2Ds) from Blue Archive.
## Description
Basically just a rainmeter skin that almost recreates lobby assistants seen within the game, for the time being each character is uploaded as a standalone skin, all of which are complete with voicelines and correct sprites on each dialogue line, do mind you as this is only a little casual project of mine, I may or may not come back regularly to update or upload a new skin.
## Dependencies
First thing's first, you need:
* Rainmeter, a free desktop customization tool in order to run the skins. You can pick it up from their website, or their github page here: https://github.com/rainmeter/rainmeter
