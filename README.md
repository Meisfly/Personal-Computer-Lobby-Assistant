# Personal-Computer-Lobby-Assistant
This is just an open repository for the author to upload and share rainmeter skins, more specifically recreations of lobby assistants (not the Live 2Ds) from Blue Archive.
## Description
Basically just a rainmeter skin that almost recreates lobby assistants seen within the game, for the time being each character is uploaded as a standalone skin, all of which are complete with voicelines and correct sprites on each dialogue line, do mind you as this is only a little casual project of mine, I may or may not come back regularly to update or upload a new skin.
## Dependencies
* Rainmeter, a free desktop customization tool in order to run the skins. You can pick it up from their website, or their github page here: https://github.com/rainmeter/rainmeter
## Installing the Skin(s)
* First, you need to install rainmeter, it is absolutely REQUIRED for you to install it.
* Next, with your downloaded rmskin file, double click on it, rainmeter's skin installer will let you install the skin without doing much effort.
* After that, a window will appear letting you confirm what to install, this includes the main lobby assistant skin, and one plugin called Mouse.dll, this file is needed for every assistant lobby character in the future, for more info about this plugin, head over here: https://github.com/NighthawkSLO/Mouse.dll/
* If you already have mouse.dll, then you don't need to install it alongside the skins, I just placed it inside the rmskin packs for convenience.
* Then finally, hit install, you will see that (if you have other skins installed apart from the lobby assistants), rainmeter will restart, don't worry though, its just rebooting the application.
## Activating the Skins
To check if the skin is installed, open Rainmeter Manager by going down to the taskbar, the hidden icons tab, and pressing on Rainmeter (the icon with the raindrop on it). It will open another window where you can manage your skins, if you see a folder that says "Personal (insert student name)" then that's it, installation is done, all you have to do to activate it is open its respective folder, then the ini folder, and then the .ini file that's named as the assistant you chose, for example, Personal Computer Hina has hina.ini. highlight that, and press on load, if the assistant loads into your desktop, then congratulations, you just installed your own PC assistant, if it didn't, press the button that says "Open Log", it should be able to tell you if there are any errors that needs to be fixed.
## Bug Fixing/Assistance for the (Code Broken) Assistants
If you are one of those people who are new to rainmeter and don't know how to fix a skin or any coding whatsoever, you can post the issue in the issues tab of this repository, I won't guarantee that I would come by everyday to check on it though.
