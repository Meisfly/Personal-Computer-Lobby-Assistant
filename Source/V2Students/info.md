This folder should contain the ini files of the rmskins with the updated code, they're not all too different from the original code, which was Hina's, but it is just ever so slightly updated by giving the students with multiple log in dialogue with well...more dialogue, and combining the ini files with different facial expressions (e.g hinalobby3a-3c) into one ini file in order to make it less complicated, the coding process became a little bit harder since some audio lines with multiple facial expressions are needed to be properly coded with the !Delay bang and multiple !SetOption bangs in order to correspond with the audio playing, when Iam speaking about dialogue lines with more than one facial expressions, Iam talking about those that have multiple reactions, like yuukalobby3 needing 3 different timed delays, images, and text in order to correlate properly with what she is saying, somewhat recreating how she would do it in the game, This in turn, gets rid of the fading effect when she continues her dialogue and decreasing the amount of ini files I have to chain together in order to make it work.

the only problem with it is the fact that the code would look like [!Delay "parameter"][!SetOption "ThisButton" "ImageName" "ImageDirectory"][!SetOption "MeterText" "Text" "parameter"][!Delay "parameter"]...and would continue on until the dialogue ends. I do have to admit though it is worth it in the end.
