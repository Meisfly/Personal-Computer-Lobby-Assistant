This folder should contain the ini files for PC Hina (Base), which is my first iteration of the code, its quite clunky, but gets the job done.

the lobby and log in dialogue with more than one sentence are separated into several ini files, this makes it easier to play that entire line without writing something absurdly long at the cost of the fact that each transition has a fading effect to it and that the amount of files inside the rmskin would increase.
