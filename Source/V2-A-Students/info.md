This is an updated code of the V2 one, with a few modifications in the code of the dialogue ini files that scales the text box alongside the text itself, so you wouldn't just see a big white box with like, 3 words in it.

also, I was unable to somehow find Shiroko_99.png in both the fandom wiki and official wiki sites, this is the image that has Shiroko blinking, without it, Shiroko would just be staring directly into your soul when you load her, if someone finds that file or a good place to pull out game resources for future builds, I would greatly appreciate it.
